\begin{itemize}

	\item What is the distribution of composition and operator usage?
	\item What are the most common file names used to define aliases? (maybe already in dataset)
\end{itemize}

\section{Usability Smell Indicators}

Take a deeper dive and classify some of the more common commands and command groups along the axes defined in the previous section. These commands could be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Unix System Tools (cd, ls, cp, mv, grep, rm, chmod, etc.)
	\item Git, Hg (Version control)
	\item Docker + docker compose, Kubernetes (Infrastructure)
	\item Package Managers (apt-get, zypper, etc.)
	\item Python, Ruby (Devops stuff? Runtime?)
\end{itemize}
