One use of aliases is to simplify complex expressions by giving them short, memorable names.
The average length of an alias name is \num{4.43} characters, whereas the average length of an alias value is \num{21.15} characters.
If we divide the length of an alias value by the length of the alias name, we get the \emph{compression ratio} of the alias.
For example, the definition
\begin{CVerbatim}
alias gs='git status'
\end{CVerbatim}
has a compression ratio of 5.
\Cref{fig:compression} shows the distribution of compression ratios over all aliases in the dataset.
The median compression ratio is 4.2, meaning half of all alias values are at least four times as long as their alias names.
A compression ratio less than 1 indicates an alias name that is longer than the value it aliases.
\Cref{tab:use-cases} gives at-a-glance compression distributions for aliases using common commands in first position.
The mini-histograms are log-log scaled; red lines mark the compression ratio 1.

There are \num{157542} aliases (\per{3.3}) with names longer than their values.%
\footnote{The curious spike at 0.36 in \cref{fig:compression} is the \texttt{zsh} portability hack described earlier.
It makes up \per{49.68} of long alias names.}
Among them, we found many descriptive names, like
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|git-last-commit-message|
    \item \verb|docker_list_all_containers|
    \item \verb|generate_random_password|
\end{itemize}
and similar wordy descriptions of simple command invocations.
Additionally, we found compatibility aliases (like \texttt{md5sum} for \texttt{md5}) and many humorous definitions (like \texttt{kthxbai} for \texttt{halt} or \texttt{please} for \texttt{sudo}).

The two longest alias names we found are from joke definitions.
The first is \num{1772} characters long and is comprised of the letter `f' repeated \num{1053} times, followed by the letter `u' repeated \num{719} times.
It is an alias for the \texttt{cat} command with a similarly named file as an argument.
The second longest alias name is a Swedish compound word of \num{131} characters,\footnote{Translating, roughly, to northwestern-glacier-artillery-flight-thrust-simulator-plant-equipment-maintenance-follow-up-systems-discussion-posts-preparation-works.} aliasing the \texttt{ls} command.

On the other end of the spectrum, the highest compression ratio in any alias definition comes from an alias named \texttt{BEEP}, which invokes the Linux \texttt{beep} utility 9 times in succession, with a combined \num{4471} arguments.
When executed, it appears to play Daft Punk's 2001 instrumental single \emph{Aerodynamic}.
