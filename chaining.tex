\subsection{Chaining}

One source of complexity (i.e. value length) in aliases is command composition or chaining.
\num{351060} aliases (\per{7.36}) are composed of more than one command.
the most popular way to combine commands is with a pipe (\verb!|!), used by \per{35.2} of multi-command aliases, closely followed by logical conjunction (\verb|&&|), used by \per{29.75}, and simple chaining (\verb|;|), used by \per{28.4}.
Other operators (\verb|&|, \verb!||!, \verb!|&!) appear in only \per{6.65} of multi-command aliases.

The pipe operator is the  most interesting, as it lets ascertain data flow between commands.
